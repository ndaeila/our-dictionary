# **📖 Our Dictionary**

**Colleague**: "What is a P&L Statement?"\
**You**: "I am not sure, but you should check **Our Dictionary!**"

🎯 Purpose
-------------
**Our Dictionary** is a centralized reference for the unique terms, acronyms, and jargon used in our business. It is designed to lower confusion for new staff, streamline communication, and promote consistency across teams. This resource is a cornerstone of our onboarding process and a go-to guide for any team member needing clarification.

🧭 Philosophy
-------------

``` 
"One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple."
 -- *Jack Kerouac*
```
Words matter. The right words make communication easy, clear, concise, and purposeful. Oftentimes in business, more specific terminology conveys complex ideas efficiently, however, some terminology and acronyms are not understood by other team members. This can create barriers for new team members or those unfamiliar with terminology and processes. Instead of letting confusion slow your team down, choose to embrace tools that make your team stronger.

**OurDictionary** exists to break down communication barriers. It demystifies your business's language, ensuring everyone is on the same page and no one feels lost. By creating a common understanding, we empower each other to collaborate better, move faster, and achieve more.

There is a reason why this technology, the dictionary, has been around since 2300 BCE - dictionaries have a track record of helping people understand things.
